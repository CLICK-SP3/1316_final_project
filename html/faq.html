			In this line of work it is important to know where and how your work will be produced before you begin to produce it, if not?, it is not uncommon for jobs to be recreated simply because of a last minute change of vendors or to incur additional production cost and/or lost time because a vendor has to make corrections to your original graphics to make them compatible with their production processes.

			Do you know which color format is proper for your job?
–Digital (on screen only jobs) are produced using RGB or Hexadecimal code. These colors are represented using a six digit number code. 
–Spot color is commonly used when you need to match a specific PMS color value. Be prepared to pay additional charges for each additional spot color used because your pressman will require an additional printing plate for every color included in your job.

			Four Color/CMYK Printing<br> (a.k.a. Full Color) is when you are using at least four colors Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black screens to simulate the full color spectrum as seen by the human eye. This is usually most expensive printing method because it requires the most time and materials to set up a press, but it can also yield some of the best results  (Full Color printing cost and specifications will vary depending on if you are using a traditional or a digital press).
